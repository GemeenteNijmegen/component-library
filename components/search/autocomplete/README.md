## Autocomplete

This component will show the autocomplete results

### Using

To start using this component, some JavaScript is needed to initialize it.<br>
Underneath a jQuery example on how to achieve this and should be placed in the `Additional component(s) script` section as documented in [How to use]({{ assetPath '/docs/how-to-use.html' }}).

```html
{{ render '@autocomplete-scripts' }}
```
