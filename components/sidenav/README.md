## Sidenav

Based on the version from MDB:<br>
https://mdbootstrap.com/legacy/4.3.2/?page=javascript/sidenav

### Using

To start using this component, some JavaScript is needed to initialize it. Underneath a jQuery example on how to achieve this.

```javascript
<script>
    $(".button-collapse").sideNav();
</script>
```

### Notes

* The sidenav and the trigger are connected by specifying a `data-activates` attribute on the trigger and a corresponding `id` on the sidenav element
