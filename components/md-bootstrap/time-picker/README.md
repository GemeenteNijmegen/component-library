## Time Picker

Based on the version from MDB:<br>
{{ mdbootstrapPath '/javascript/time-picker/' }}

### Notes

* The hidden input can then be ignored when collecting results
* For the best accessibility support the label should contain the time format, and not just the placeholder
* MDB framework defines that the input element comes prior to the label element
* It's best practice to have an input element accompanied with a label element which are *connected* via the `for` attribute on the label element and the corresponding `id` on the input element
