## Forminputs Template

A custom template created for Nijmegen to showcase various form input components from this library in one overall view.

### Notes

* Used components: see the "References" in the component library info tab
* When you don't need the action attribute in the form (for example when you handle the submission with javascript) don't leave the action attribute empty but leave out the action attribute completely.
