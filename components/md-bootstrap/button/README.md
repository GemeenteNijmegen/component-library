## Button

Based on the version from MDB:<br>
{{ mdbootstrapPath '/components/buttons/#basic-buttons' }}

No additional actions, aside from the markup, are needed to use this component.

### Notes

* MDB defines 7 predefined buttons styles, yet Nijmegen only needed 3 therefor the library supports `info`, `primary` and `secondary`.
