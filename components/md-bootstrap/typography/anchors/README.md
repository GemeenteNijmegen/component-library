## Anchors

The designers style guide (built by Stroomt) has a typography section with specific typography styling for Nijmegen.

The custom anchors, as defined in the style guide, can be seen in the preview panel.

### Using

Place text that can contain links in a container with the class `text-section`. This ensures that the links will be underlined.

Links that are not placed in the "text-section" container won't be underlined but will change color slightly on focus/active/hover.
