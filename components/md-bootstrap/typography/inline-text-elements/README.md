## Inline Text Elements

The designers style guide (built by Stroomt) has a typography section with specific typography styling for Nijmegen.

The custom inline text elements, as defined in the style guide, can be seen in the preview panel.

### Choosing the correct element

Make sure you choose the correct semantic element to improve accessibility.

More info about the elements:
- `<del>` https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/del
- `<s>` https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/s
- `<ins>` https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/u
- `<small>` https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/small
- `<strong>` https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/strong
- `<em>` https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/em

We intentionally used a class to underline text since the `<u>` element is not meant to be used for that, see: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/u.

### Using

No additional actions, aside from the markup, are needed to use this component.
