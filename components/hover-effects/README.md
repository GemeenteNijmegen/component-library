## Hover Effects

Based on the version from MDB:<br>
{{ mdbootstrapPath '/css/hover-effects/#basic-examples' }}

### Accessibility

Regarding the `alt` attribute on the images, please follow the decision tree as can be seen here https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/decision-tree/

### Using

No additional actions, aside from the markup, are needed to use this component.

### Notes

* MDB defines more hover effects, yet Nijmegen only needed 3 therefor the library supports `light`, `strong` and `super light` overlays.
