This list is only a selection of the icons that we offer and which are currently being used by Nijmegen. For the full list, please visit [materialdesignicons](https://materialdesignicons.com/). If you use an icon but it does not work, it may be that it has been removed when you upgraded to a new version or that we are not yet up to date with the latest version of Materialdesignicons. In that case, please feel free to contact us.
