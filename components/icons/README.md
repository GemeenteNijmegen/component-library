## Icons (Material Design)

Nijmegen requested to add Material Design Icons (https://materialdesignicons.com) to this framework instead of the default that comes with the MDB framework.

In above preview panel, all icons available in this framework are displayed.

### Accessibility

When using an icon for decorative reason, be sure to add `aria-hidden="true"` to the icon to hide it for assistive technologies.<br>

No additional actions, aside from the markup, are needed to use these icons.
