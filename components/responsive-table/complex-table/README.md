## Complex Responsive Table

A custom component created for Nijmegen, based on this [CSS-Tricks demo](https://css-tricks.com/examples/ResponsiveTables/responsive.php).

### Using

To start using this component and facilitate a correct layout on mobile devices, some JavaScript is needed to initialize it.<br>
Underneath a jQuery example on how to achieve this and should be placed in the `Additional component(s) script` section as documented in [How to use]({{ assetPath '/docs/how-to-use.html' }}).

```javascript
{{ render '@complex-table-scripts' }}
```
