## Complex Responsive Table

A custom component created for Nijmegen, based on this [CSS-Tricks demo](https://css-tricks.com/examples/ResponsiveTables/responsive.php).

### Notes

- The caption element functions as a heading for the table. Captions help (screen-reader) users to find a table and understand what it's about.
- If the caption is not wanted visually you can hide this by applying the class `sr-only`
