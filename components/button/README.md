## Button

Based on the version from MDB:<br>
https://mdbootstrap.com/legacy/4.3.2/?page=components/buttons#basic-buttons

### Using

No additional actions, aside from the markup, are needed to use this component.

### Notes

* MDB defines 7 predefined buttons styles, yet Nijmegen only needed 3 therefor the library supports `info`, `primary` and `secondary`.
