## Time Picker

Based on the version from MDB:<br>
https://mdbootstrap.com/legacy/4.3.2/?page=javascript/time-picker

### Using

No additional actions, aside from the markup, are needed to use this component.

### Notes

* For demo purpose only, the time picker opens automatically.
* MDB framework defines that the input element comes prior to the label element
* It's best practice to have an input element accompanied with a label element which are *connected* via the `for` attribute on the label element and the corresponding `id` on the input element
