## Listing

This is a custom component which mainly consists of a title and content wrapped in an anchor
so the full element is clickable.

### Accessibility

We do not use the `aria-labelledby` attribute on the anchor in order to ensure the entire link text is readable by screen readers.

### Using

No additional actions, aside from the markup, are needed to use this component.

### Notes

* The title in this component is rendered via a `h1` element, every heading (`h1 - h6`) will work so choose your own heading according the structure of the page.
