## Tabs

Based on the version from MDB:<br>
{{ mdbootstrapPath '/components/tabs/#classic-tabs' }}

### Using

To start using this component, some JavaScript is needed to initialize it.<br>
Underneath is an example on how to achieve this and should be placed in the `Additional component(s) script` section as documented in [How to use]({{ assetPath '/docs/how-to-use.html' }}).

```html
{{ render '@tabs-scripts' }}
```
