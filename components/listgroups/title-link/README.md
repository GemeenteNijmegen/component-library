## Title Link

*A list group consisting of links with a group title*

Based on the version from MDB:<br>
{{ mdbootstrapPath '/components/list-group/#linked-items' }}

### Using

No additional actions, aside from the markup, are needed to use this component.

### Notes

* The group title in this component is rendered via a paragraph element, since it's unknown in advance what the implementors document heading level structure would be, it's not advisable to define a specific heading element (`H1 - H6`) in this component.<br>
**However**, the component has been structured to work with every heading (`H1 - H6`) level as group title, so you are free to use which heading level suits your use-case.
