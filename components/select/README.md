## Select

Based on the version from MDB:<br>
{{ mdbootstrapPath '/javascript/material-select/#basic' }}

### Using

To start using this component, some JavaScript is needed to initialize it.<br>
Underneath a jQuery example on how to achieve this and should be placed in the `Additional component(s) script` section as documented in [How to use]({{ assetPath '/docs/how-to-use.html' }}).

```javascript
{{ render '@tpl-script-select-config' }}
```

### Notes

* MDB framework defines that the input element comes prior to the label element
