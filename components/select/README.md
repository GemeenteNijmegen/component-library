## Material Select

Based on the version from MDB (https://mdbootstrap.com/legacy/4.3.2/?page=javascript/material-select)

### Using the select element in HTML

Aside from the JavaScript libraries, you need to initialise the Material Select components.
This can be done by adding underneath JavaScript and make sure it's placed after the
required JavaScript files used by the framework

```javascript
<script>
// Assuming you've given your Select element a classname of 'mdb-select'
$('.mdb-select').material_select();
</script>
```
