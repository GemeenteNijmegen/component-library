## Select

Based on the version from MDB:<br>
https://mdbootstrap.com/legacy/4.3.2/?page=javascript/material-select

### Using

To start using this component, some JavaScript is needed to initialize it.<br>
Underneath a jQuery example on how to achieve this and should be placed in the `Additional component(s) script` section as documented in [How to use](/docs/how-to-use).

```javascript
<script>
    $('.mdb-select').material_select();
</script>
```

### Notes

* MDB framework defines that the input element comes prior to the label element
