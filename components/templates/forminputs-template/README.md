## Forminputs Template

A custom template created for Nijmegen to showcase various form input components from this library in one overall view.

### Notes

* Used components: see the "References" in the component library info tab
* When you don't want to specify an action attribute don't leave it empty, following the accessibility rules you should either delete it and it will fallback to action='/' or use action='/' yourself
