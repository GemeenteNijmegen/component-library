### Using

To start using this component, some JavaScript is needed to initialize it.<br>
Underneath is an example on how to achieve this and should be placed in the `Additional component(s) script` section as documented in [How to use]({{ assetPath '/docs/how-to-use.html' }}).

```html
{{ render '@aria-switch-scripts' }}
```

### Notes

* The given label text should be descriptive enough for users using screen readers to understand what ticked/unticked (true/false) means.
