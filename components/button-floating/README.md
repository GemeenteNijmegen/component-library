## Button floating

Based on the version from MDB:<br>
https://mdbootstrap.com/legacy/4.3.2/?page=components/buttons#floating-buttons

### Accessibility

Be sure to add textual content to the button so this will be available to assistive technologies. The text can be visually hidden to the user
by applying a `class="sr-only"` to the child element containing the text.<br>
When using an icon as part of the button content, be sure to add `aria-hidden="true"` to the icon to hide it for assistive technologies since it's here for decorative reasons.<br>
