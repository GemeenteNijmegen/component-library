## Navbar

To set an active menu item, underneath HTML markup for a navigation item can be used where a class "active" is added to the active menu item and as and extra addition regarding accessibility the "span" can be used.

```html
<li class="nav-item active">
    <a href="#" class="nav-link">Menu active <span class="sr-only">(current)</span></a>
</li>
```
