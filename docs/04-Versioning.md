title: Versioning
status: ready # draft, ready
---

This component library uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).<br>
Which comes done to the following;

> Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:
> 
> 1. MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
> 2. MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
> 3. PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.


The version information can be found in the [changelog](changelog.html)<br>
<br>
Every major versions has a unique url (by adding the version as prefix, for example `/v1/`) to make sure users of this CL can switch to a new major version when they have implemented the backwards-incompatible changes.<br>
<br>
The latest major version is specified on the [landingspage](https://componenten.nijmegen.nl/), please make sure you keep using the stable version.
